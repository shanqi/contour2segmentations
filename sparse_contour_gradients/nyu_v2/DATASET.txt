The NYU Depth Dataset (v2) is from Silberman et al and is available at:

http://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html

Run the script convert_dataset.m to download the dataset, reduce the resolution
to half (320x240), clean up some "double contours" in the groundtruth, and save
them in the Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark (BSDS) format. Once in BSDS format,
it is easy to modify the Berkeley gPb benchmarking code to point to the new
dataset locations. The data is split into 60% training and 40% test, randomly.

"Double contours" refer to minor artifacts in the NYU groundtruth where the
labels are given as semantic regions, not scene segmentations. Thus
occassionally a thin strip of unlabeled pixels exist between two regions that
should be adjacent, and it is a problem for a boundary/segmentation evaluation.
We have a simple median filtering step to remedy the issue.

seg2bdry.m is from the Berkeley gPb software.
mediannan_int.m is modified from the code shown at http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/251787.
